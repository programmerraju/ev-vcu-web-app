EV-VCU-WEB-APP is a web application designed to provide users with real-time data and potentially control functionalities of their electric scooter (EV) equipped with a Vehicle Control Unit (VCU).
## EV-VCU-WEB-APP: Web Application for Electric Scooter Monitoring

**Project Description**

EV-VCU-WEB-APP is a web application designed to allow users to monitor and interact with their electric scooter equipped with a Vehicle Control Unit (VCU). This project is specifically designed for ECOVESPA scooters, but the core concepts can be applicable to other electric scooter models with compatible VCU APIs.

**Functionalities:**

* **Real-time Scooter Data:** View essential information about your scooter's current status, including:
    * Speed (km/h)
    * Battery Level (%)
    * Motor Temperature (C)
    * Riding Mode (if applicable, Eco, Sport, etc.)
    * Brake Status (engaged/disengaged)
    * (Optional) Additional sensor data like ambient temperature
* **Data Visualization:** The web app presents this data in a user-friendly and informative way using charts, gauges, or other visual elements.
* **(Optional) Control Functionalities:** Depending on the VCU API's capabilities, the web app might allow users to control certain aspects of the scooter, such as selecting riding modes (Eco, Sport).

**Benefits:**

* Enhanced user experience by providing real-time data on scooter health and performance.
* Improved safety through alerts for potential issues like high motor temperature or low battery level.
* (Optional) Feature control by allowing users to switch riding modes for optimized performance or efficiency.

**Target Users:**

* EV scooter owners (ECOVESPA and potentially compatible models).
* People interested in monitoring and potentially controlling their electric scooter remotely.

**Technical Stack (Placeholder):**

* Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Framework (e.g., React, Angular)
* Back-End: Server-side scripting language (e.g., Python, Node.js)
* Communication Protocol: REST API over HTTP

**Getting Started (Placeholder):**

1. Install necessary development tools (code editor, front-end/back-end development environment).
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. (For Back-End) Configure the back-end environment and establish connection with the VCU API (if available).
4. Run the development server.
5. Access the web app in your web browser.

**Note:**  This is a placeholder for the technical stack and getting started instructions. Specific details will depend on the chosen technologies and functionalities implemented.

**Deployment (Placeholder):**

The web application can be deployed on various platforms depending on your needs. Here are some options:

* Static hosting platforms (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) - Suitable for simple deployments with mostly static content.
* Cloud-based hosting providers (Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure) - Offer more flexibility and scalability for complex applications.
